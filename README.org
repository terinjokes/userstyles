#+title: UserStyles

* About
This is a collection of userstyles to adjust the styling of websites I commonly use. Currently there are two styles, Nord Dark Mode and Maximum Density.

** Nord Dark Mode

A dark mode style that uses the Nord color scheme to provide an arctic night's flair to the web.

** Maximum Density

A style that increases the density of the web by reducing margins and padding. It is inspired by (and can often be paired with) [[https://github.com/phil294/density-userstyle][density-userstyle]].
